// This is a utility script that you can run to update all footer pages with proper imports
/* 
Steps to follow for each of the remaining pages:

1. Import { Link } from 'react-router-dom' at the top of each file
2. Import { Footer } from '@/components/layout/Footer' at the top of each file
3. Replace the entire footer section with <Footer /> component

This script doesn't need to be executed, it's just a reference for manually updating each file.
